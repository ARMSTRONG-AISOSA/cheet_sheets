## 🔹 Option 1: Using **Live Server Extension** in VS Code

This is the most common way.

1. Open VS Code and install the **Live Server extension** by Ritwick Dey.
   * Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
   * Search **Live Server** → Install.

2. Open your project folder in VS Code.

3. Right-click your `index.html` → **"Open with Live Server"**.

4. It will start a local server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`) and auto-refresh when you save changes.

👉 If you want to run it from the **terminal inside VS Code**:

* Use `Alt+L Alt+O` (shortcut) or
* Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → search `Live Server: Open With Live Server`.

## 🔹 Option 2: Using Node.js + `live-server` (from terminal)

If you want to run Live Server **directly from the terminal**, you can install it globally.

1. Make sure you have **Node.js + npm** installed.
   Check:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. Install `live-server` globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   ```

3. Navigate to your project folder in the terminal:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

4. Run Live Server:
   ```bash
   live-server
   ```

5. It will open your default browser at something like:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/
   ```

Benefit running **Live Server via Node + terminal** 
Here are the key **benefits**:

---
### 🔹 1. Works Outside VS Code
* The VS Code extension only works **inside VS Code**.
* With Node + terminal, you can use Live Server no matter what editor you’re using (Sublime, Vim, Atom, even just Notepad).

---
### 🔹 2. Easier for Collaboration
* If you share your project with teammates, they don’t need to install the same VS Code extension.
* Running `npm install` (with `live-server` added as a dev dependency) ensures everyone gets the same setup.

---
### 🔹 3. Custom Scripts with `package.json`
* You can define a **start command** in `package.json` like:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "live-server"
  }
  ```
* Then just run:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
* This makes it **standardized** and easy for any developer (or deployment system) to run.

---
### 🔹 4. Flexible Configuration
* Node-based Live Server lets you:
  * Change the port (`live-server --port=3000`)
  * Disable auto-open browser (`live-server --no-browser`)
  * Watch specific directories (`live-server ./public`)

Example:

```bash
code:
    live-server --port=5000 --no-browser ./src
```

---
### 🔹 5. Cross-Platform & Automation
* Works the same way on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
* You can combine it with other **Node tools** like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel for more advanced development.
* Easy to integrate into **automation scripts** or CI/CD workflows.

---

✅ **In short**:
* **VS Code Live Server** = quick, easy, good for beginners.
* **Node + terminal Live Server** = more flexible, works anywhere, and scales better for professional workflows.
